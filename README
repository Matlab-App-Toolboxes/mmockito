welcome!

Issues can be reported on the projects' Github page; code should also be 
submitted as pull requests. Pull requests should include the 
necessary tests; tests should be passing at all times.

Usage
=====

The 'mmockito' directory should be added to MATLAB's path; it contains the most
used classes. The main functionality is provided by the "Mock" class, which
supports both stubbing and verification. In-order verification is provided by
the "InOrder" class. The "Matcher" class is an interface for specifying
argument matchers, "Any", "ArgThat" and "AnyArgs" are commonly used matchers.
Some further matchers are provided in the mmockito.matchers package. The
mmockito.internal package has internal class which should not be used by
end-users.

For more detailed information consult the help files of individual classes.

More documentation, including a detailed overview of features and 
comparison to Java Mockito, are available in my bachelor's thesis:

Tests
=====

To run tests, use the runtests function, which returns a TestResult object:

    r = runtests('all');

Other options are 'acceptance', 'unit', or the exact name of a unit test file.

MATLAB 2013a or higher is required to run the tests.
